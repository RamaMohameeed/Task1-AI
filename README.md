# Bird vs. Drone Image Classification System  
*A Machine Learning Project using Teachable Machine, TensorFlow and Jira/Xray*

---

##  Overview

This repository showcases a deployable image classification system trained to distinguish between **Bird** and **Drone** images. The model is developed using **Google Teachable Machine**, exported in TensorFlow Keras format, and integrated with a Python-based inference pipeline using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**.  
Test management is professionally handled via **Jira + Xray**, simulating a real-world software QA workflow.
